# About CarToolHQ

We're a team of automotive enthusiasts and DIY mechanics who got tired of wasting money on tools that didn't live up to their promises.

## Our Mission

**Stop Guessing. Start Wrenching.**

We test automotive tools and accessories so you don't have to. Every product we review goes through real-world testing—no marketing fluff, no paid placements.

## Our Testing Process

1. **Purchase products** with our own money (or borrow from friends)
2. **Test in real scenarios** - actual automotive work, not lab conditions
3. **Compare head-to-head** - side-by-side testing reveals true winners
4. **Report honestly** - we call out flaws and highlight strengths

## How We Make Money

CarToolHQ participates in affiliate programs, primarily Amazon Associates. When you purchase a product through our links, we earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This helps fund our testing and keeps the lights on.

**We never:**
- Accept payment for positive reviews
- Recommend products we haven't tested
- Hide the cons to make a sale
